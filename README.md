# Bubble Sort Visualization in Python

This project demonstrates a simple implementation of the Bubble Sort algorithm in Python, enhanced with step-by-step visualization in the console.

## Features

- Visualizes each step of the Bubble Sort process.
- Highlights the elements being compared and swapped.
- Runs directly in the console/terminal.
- Simple and easy to customize.

## Usage

1. Clone this repository or copy the script.
2. Run the script using Python 3:

    ```bash
    python bubble_sort_visualization.py
    ```

3. The script will display the sorting process for a sample list. You can modify the `sample` list in the script to test with different inputs.

## Example Output

```
Initial list:
 5   1   4   2   8 
Step: i=0, j=0
[5] [1]  4   2   8 
Swapping 5 and 1
 1  [5] [4]  2   8 
...
Sorted list:
 1   2   4   5   8 
```

## Customization

- Change the list to be sorted by editing the `sample` variable in the script.
- Adjust the visualization speed by modifying the `time.sleep()` values.
